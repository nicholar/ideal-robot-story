Collum walked through the dark hallways that made up the Archemage's wing.
The Archemage was his father's most trusted advisor, and yet Ezran always
gave Collum the chills. Plus, his decor left something to be desired.
Each door in the hallway seemed more dreadful than the last. Strange smells
and sounds dominated the senses of any soul unlucky enough  to be tasked
with a journey to this part of the castle. 
Collum slowly walked through the hallway until he reached the end. There was
one large door at the end of the hallway. It was bigger than any other door, 
and it was a royal blue color. He slowly opened the door. A bat flew out. It 
was pitch black. He felt around until he finally found the light switch. He 
turned it on and was shocked to see what was in the room.
